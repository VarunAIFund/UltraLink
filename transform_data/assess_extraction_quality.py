You are a data quality analyst. Compare the raw LinkedIn data with the AI-processed structured data and assess the extraction quality.

Raw Data (input): Contains original LinkedIn profile data from scraping
Processed Data (output): Contains AI-enhanced structured profiles

Here is the exact prompt that was used to transform the raw data:
\"\"\"
Based on the following candidate data, extract and infer the remaining profile information.
IMPORTANT: All output must be in English. If any content is in any other languages, translate it to English.

  * company_skills: List of technical and domain skills typically associated with working at this specific company based on experience description and implied skills (e.g., for Google: ["distributed systems", "machine learning", "cloud computing", "search algorithms"]; for Stripe: ["payments", "fintech", "API design", "financial systems"]; for Meta: ["social media", "advertising", "mobile development", "data analytics"]; for Pinecone: ["vector databases", "embeddings", "similarity search", "machine learning", "RAG", "AI infrastructure"])
  * business_model: Business model category (choose from: B2B, B2C, B2B2C, C2C, B2G) based on the company's primary business model

Data to analyze:
{json.dumps(comparison_data, indent=2)}

Please provide a comprehensive quality assessment covering:

1. **Data Completeness**:
   - Are all important fields from raw data preserved in processed data?
   - What percentage of fields were successfully extracted/transformed?
   - Were any critical data points lost during processing?

2. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Do the processed fields accurately reflect the raw data?
   - Are company names, job titles, locations correctly extracted?
   - Are experience summaries accurate representations of the source?

3. **Data Enhancement**:
   - What new valuable information was added by AI processing?
   - How well did AI infer seniority levels, skills, business models?
   - Quality of generated summaries and classifications?

4. **Processing Success**:
   - Were all records successfully processed?
   - Any obvious processing errors or inconsistencies?
   - Overall success rate of the extraction pipeline?

5. **Areas for Improvement**:
   - What aspects of the extraction could be enhanced?
   - Any patterns in extraction failures or inaccuracies?
   - Recommendations for improving the AI processing?

Please provide specific examples from the data and actionable insights.

At the end, provide final scores (0-100) for each category:

**FINAL SCORES:**
- Data Completeness Score: X/100
- Data Accuracy Score: X/100  
- Data Enhancement Score: X/100
- Processing Success Score: X/100
- Overall Quality Score: X/100

Provide brief justification for each score.
